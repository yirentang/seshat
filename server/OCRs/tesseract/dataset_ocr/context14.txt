Questions 4-8 are based on the following passage.

The passage is adapted from a speech delivered by Congresswoman Barbara
Jordan of Texas on July 25, 1974. She was a member of the Judiciary Committee
of the United States House of Representatives. In the passage, Jordan discusses
how and when a United States president may be impeached, or charged with
serious offenses while in office. Jordan’s speech was delivered in the context of
impeachment hearings against then President Richard M. Nixon.

Today, I am an inquisitor. An hyperbole would not be
fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that I feel
right now. My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is

Line complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an
5 idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the
destruction, of the Constitution.

“Who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as
the representatives of the nation themselves?” “The subjects of
its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the

10 misconduct of public men.”* And that’s what we're talking
about. In other words, [the jurisdiction comes] from the abuse
or violation of some public trust.

It is wrong, I suggest, it is a misreading of the Constitution
for any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an

15 article of impeachment means that that member must be
convinced that the President should be removed from office.
