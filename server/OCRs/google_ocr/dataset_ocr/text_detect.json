  "14": "Questions 4-8 are based on the following passage.\nThe passage is adapted from a speech delivered by Congresswoman Barbara\nJordan of Texas on July 25, 1974. She was a member of the Judiciary Committee\nof the United States House of Representatives. In the passage, Jordan discusses\nhow and when a United States president may be impeached, or charged with\nserious offenses while in office. Jordan's speech was delivered in the context of\nimpeachment hearings against then President Richard M. Nixon.\nToday, I am an\nfictional and would not overstate the solemnness that I feel\ninquisitor. An hyperbole would not be\nright now. My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is\nLine Complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an\n5 idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the\ndestruction, of the Constitution\n\"Who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as\nthe representatives of the nation themselves?\" \"The subjects of\nits jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the\n10 misconduct of public men.\"* And that's what we're talking\nabout. In other words, [the jurisdiction comes] from the abuse\nor violation of some public trust.\nIt is wrong, I suggest, it is a misreading of the Constitution\nfor any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an\n15 article of impeachment means that that member must be\nconvinced that the President should be removed from office.\n"
